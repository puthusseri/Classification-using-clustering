A Novel Approach for Classification Using Clustering -A Case Study on Heart Disease Prediction

********************* About this project ***************
--------------------------------------------------------

In this work, the heart disease database   is   preprocessed 
to make the mining process more efficient.  The preprocessed
 data is clustered using K-Means to achieve better clustering
 result. Na√Øve Bayes classifier algorithm is applied  on the 
clustered data for building the predictive model.


********************* Requirements *********************
