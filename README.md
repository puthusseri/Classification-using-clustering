A Novel Approach for Classification Using Clustering -A Case Study on Heart Disease Prediction
*********************************************************



The project work entitled “     A NOVEL APPROACH    FOR 
CLASSIFICATION USING CLUSTERING - A CASE STUDY ON HEART 
DISEASE PREDICTION ”  is a RESEARCH LEVEL PROJECT done by
 Vyshak Puthusseri & Sreeragh M of BSc Comp. Science    , 
Mahatma Gandhi College Iritty 2014-27 batch.

********************* About this project ***************
--------------------------------------------------------

In this work, the heart disease database   is   preprocessed 
to make the mining process more efficient.  The preprocessed
 data is clustered using K-Means to achieve better clustering
 result. Naïve Bayes classifier algorithm is applied  on the 
clustered data for building the predictive model.


********************* Requirements *********************
--------------------------------------------------------


	1.The project was done in FLASK framework.
	
	2.Pyhon 2.7 was used for that.
	
	3.Can Install flask using pip command as
